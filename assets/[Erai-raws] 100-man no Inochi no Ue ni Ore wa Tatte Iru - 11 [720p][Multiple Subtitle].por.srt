Majiha Pink, there is no light \Nof hope remaining for you!
You're wrong!
Behold!
Majiha Purple!
Basashi! Gyuusashi!
Do you still wish to continue?
Give it up!
It's over!
I, Demon King Lukifel, will rule this \Nworld with the darkness of despair.
This is the beginning of \Nthe darkest of nights,
in which I suck up the dreams of \Nall children around the world!
I won't give up.
I won't let you do that.
No matter what happens, I...
We, the Majiha Sisters, will never give up!
Because we believe in the future!
I can feel you, Majiha Purple.
We believe in love!
The light of hope will never disappear.
It's always burning...
...right here!
With my crimson flame...
...I will burn all!

Love and friendship, courage and hope...
I believed that if I had those, I could be \Nan awesome magical girl and save the world.
Majiha... Fire.
Of course... there's no \Nway I could ever be one.

I talked trash about them \Nbehind their backs,

I'd cling to them.
They all did the same thing...

You've gotta be able to \Nread the room to get by.
What's so wrong about that?

I... revived?
When that happened, \NI was sure it was all over.
Where am I?

Is this a secret dungeon?
Interesting.

This world...

There is a concept by that na.
Parallel worlds?

and there is a you who \Nfollows the right path...
as well as a you in a world based on \Ndifferent possibilities who goes left.
The you in the world based on different \Npossibilities who goes left

For that reason, \Nevery time we make a decision,

So what if that decision was made not \Ntoday, but three years from now?
Among the parallel worlds,
there would exist a world in \Nwhich I died in an accid.

Among the parallel worlds,
there would be one in which \Nyour parents died twenty years ag.

Naturally, that means \Nyou would not be born.
In this way, parallel worlds become \Nmore and more unrealistic
the farther they branch out from \Nthe past from which they origina.
This branching
has been repeating eternally \Nsince the birth of the univer.
Does that mean the number of parallel \Nworlds is basically infinite?
We are capable of using special methods
to observe and travel between parallel \Nworlds that meet a certain conditio.
The condition is that the worlds \Nexist on a similar wavelength.
Which means that world is...
a world that branched off \N4.6 billion years ago,
where a sentient race identical \Nto humans came to exist
and lived through a history \Nsimilar to human history.
It is an Earth based on different possibil.
What does that mean?!
You do not have the right to ask a ques.
Of course, the name of the planet, \Nthe things it is made of,
and its terrain are diff.
But it is not a virtual realit.
It is a planet that exists in the same \Nplace as Earth in a parallel wor.
If anything, you are the only things \Nin this world that are virtu.
We're virtual?
Well, I guess if we weren't, \Nwe couldn't come back from the dead.
True.
Which means all of the \Nother things there...
the sky, the seas, the land,
